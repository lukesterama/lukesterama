- 👋 Hi, I’m @lukesterama
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about programming and apply it to my current work experience 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning through the ODIN Project
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that will give access to those that have none and make things like education, more accessible
